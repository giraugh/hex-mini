# Hex (mini)

Hex is a platform for creating and testing AI bots that compete at the board game "Hex" as invented by John Nash. This is a successor to hex-redux that provides some nice quality of life features. The platform might be a little confronting at first but head on over to the wiki page [here](https://github.com/giraugh/hex-mini/wiki/Basic-API) and it should start making more sense.
